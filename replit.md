# ŸÜÿ∏ÿßŸÖ ÿ•ÿØÿßÿ±ÿ© Ahmed Abdulqader Company

## Overview
This project is an integrated management system developed in PHP with a PostgreSQL database, designed to manage core business operations for Ahmed Abdulqader Company. Its primary purpose is to streamline financial and inventory processes, supporting both Yemeni Rial and US Dollar currencies. The system aims to enhance efficiency in managing customers, suppliers, inventory, sales, purchases, financial vouchers, and electronic documents, providing a comprehensive solution for business administration.

## User Preferences
The system should prioritize ease of use and professional design. It should maintain a clear and intuitive user interface, especially for financial reports like account statements, which require a professional, print-ready format. Data integrity and security are paramount, particularly concerning financial transactions and inventory management. The system must support Arabic language fully with RTL (Right-to-Left) design. Any new features or modifications should integrate seamlessly with the existing dual-currency support and robust security measures.

## System Architecture
The system is built on PHP 8.2 with a PostgreSQL database. The frontend utilizes HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, with a strong emphasis on RTL design for full Arabic language support.
